##Sourcefinder (Sourcerous)

###Introduction
The project is based on Django and Html5 and basically designed for Journalists. The live demo is on http://sourcerous.herokuapp.com/Sourcerous/ .

Given a topic or (more tractably) the name of a company or institution, find people who are good sources to contact.  Technologies include Alchemy API (A Natural Language Processing API), Google News and Yahoo Finance API, multithreading. Finding important contact people mentioned in popular online articles, looking at LinkedIn profiles or people quoted in previous coverage of this topic,  with links to the original source material.  A good method of expansion once given a “seed” set of possible contacts (whether from the organization’s web site or previous articles) would be to find people or organizations whose names co-occur in online documents—and then people or organizations whose names co-occur with those, etc. [For journalists]
